[View this course on Langara](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/courses/CPSC/1091.html)

## Course Description

Amongst the many skills required of engineers is the ability to clearly communicate their designs and engineering analyses using both verbal and graphical languages. In this project-based course, students explore the engineering design process and develop their ability to use engineering communication tools. Working in teams, they examine the technical background of a well-defined problem and use engineering drawing and CAD to design potential solutions. Through this process, students experience professional responsibility and develop their writing and presentation skills.
