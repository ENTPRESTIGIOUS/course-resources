[View this course on Langara](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/courses/CPSC/1490.html)

## Course Description

A systems level microcontroller case study and project course that explores the design of embedded microcontroller systems as solutions to a set of practical problems. Course activities start with specific case studies and labs that apply scientific principles and technical knowledge. Activities then evolve to student-led and student driven team collaborative projects with specific practical goals under instructor mentorship. Projects will require teams to document and present their project design solutions to the entire class and to be able to illustrate key aspects of their solution using projected slides, engineering graphics, and live demonstrations.

## Prerequisites
