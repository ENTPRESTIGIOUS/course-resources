> Formerly CPSC 1490

## Course Description

The design of engineering systems strives to integrate mechanical, electronic, and computer technologies in order to create optimal products. Students expand on their understanding of engineering design and explore the design of systems comprising of electrical, mechanical, and software subsystems. They apply scientific principles and technical knowledge in student-led and student-driven team collaborative projects with specific practical goals. Projects require teams to document and present their project design solutions and to illustrate key aspects of their solution using projected slides, engineering graphics, and live demonstrations. Students also learn the concept of sustainability and its impact on engineering design as well as engineering ethical practices.

## Prerequisites
